## The Orange is the sole bane of doctor's primary existence 🍊

Hey there, I'm a human who uses Unix with 14.75-unix-years-old kernal, that means i am 14 years old dummy! I use Eyes as my Windows Manager. Tis' nerd likes linux, uses NixOS with AwesomeWM. Currently in 10th Grade as a Computer Science idiot, hopefully a full stacks dev someday... But that's for later.
I'm working on something... _big_
