I go by El1i0r, or El1.I am currently a CS student in high school, and am interested in Operating Systems Development, Programming Language Design and Implementation, and Robotics and aspire to become a professional computer scientist. I am currently working on different open source projects related to my interests, including Wlek, a hobby project for learning the inner workings of Operating Systems, and Rosewud, a programming language for critical systems. You can call it a grandiose delusion, but I intend to do more than just hobbies.
